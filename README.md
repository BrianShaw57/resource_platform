# InTEACT BSSS 2020 IT Courses Resource Project

This repository will store the resources and platform for the InTEACT BSSS 2020 IT Courses project.

[Information Technology Educators ACT (InTEACT)](https://inteact.act.edu.au/) is the Professional Association for IT educators in the ACT. In 2020, the [ACT Board of Senior Secondary Studies (BSSS)](http://bsss.act.edu.au/) is replacing the existing IT course for senior secondary students in the ACT with 4 new IT courses:
* Data Science
* Digital Technologies
* Networking and Security
* Robotics and Mechatronics

InTEACT has secured funding through the [Google Computer Science Educator Professional Development Grants](https://edu.google.com/computer-science/educator-grants/) to develop resources directly aligned to the curriculum goals and outcomes in all four courses. In 2019, InTEACT will be developing resource packages and teaching program guidance for the first two units in each of the courses:
* Data Science - Data Representation & Analysis; Big Data Analysis & Techniques
* Digital Technologies - Digital Assets; Digital Systems
* Networking and Security - Networking & Cyber Security; Network Administration & Security
* Robotics and Mechatronics - Building & Programming Circuits; Digital & Analog Interactions

These resources will be made freely available to all teachers and students. InTEACT also welcomes contributions from other educators, students, professionals and interested parties - simply submit a pull request if you would like to contribute other resources and activities.

Resources for the other units in the courses will still be accepted, but resources for the unis listed above will be prioritised by the review team.

## Structure of this repository

The root level of the repository contains a separate folder for each of the courses. Within each folder is a `contrib` folder where contributors are encouraged to add suggestions for resources, activities, tutorials or assessment tasks that may not be in a state where they are "classroom-ready".

The `resources` folder is reserved for resources that are in a classroom-ready state.

## Contributing to this repository

To contribute to this repository, fork this project and submit a pull request with your contribution added per the contribution rules below:

### Contributing a teaching resource

If you have a resource that is classroom-ready or requires only minor review to be prepared for student use, create a new folder inside the `resources` folder that contains all assets for that resource.

Pull requests that add resources directly to the `curated` folder will not be accepted. This folder is used by the review team to differentiate between those resources that have been reviewed and those awaiting review.

### Suggesting a resource for inclusion in a teaching resource

If you are not an educator but have a resource, activity, application or tool that could be useful in a teaching resource (but you may not be sure how), you can still contribute (and we encourage you to do so)!

Add a new folder inside the relevant `contrib` folder that contains the resources, code samples or activities for conversion into a teaching resource. Your contribution may be as simple as a text file containing a URL, or could be a full-blow application.

### Simple contributions without a GitHub account

If you are contributing a resource that is relatively simple (such as a URL) and do not have a GitHub account (or would rather not submit a pull request) you can send an email to [contribute@inteact.act.edu.au](mailto:contribute@inteact.act.edu.au) and it can be added to the repository on your behalf.
