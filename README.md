# InTEACT BSSS 2020 IT Courses Resource Project

This repository will store the resources and platform for the InTEACT BSSS 2020 IT Courses project.

[Information Technology Educators ACT (InTEACT)](https://inteact.act.edu.au/) is the Professional Association for IT educators in the ACT. In 2020, the [ACT Board of Senior Secondary Studies (BSSS)](http://bsss.act.edu.au/) is replacing the existing IT course for senior secondary students in the ACT with 4 new IT courses:
* Data Science
* Digital Technologies
* Networking and Security
* Robotics and Mechatronics

InTEACT has secured funding through the [Google Computer Science Educator Professional Development Grants](https://edu.google.com/computer-science/educator-grants/) to develop resources directly aligned to the curriculum goals and outcomes in all four courses. In 2019, InTEACT will be developing resource packages and teaching program guidance for the first two units in each of the courses:
* Data Science - Data Representation & Analysis; Big Data Analysis & Techniques
* Digital Technologies - Digital Assets; Digital Systems
* Networking and Security - Networking & Cyber Security; Network Administration & Security
* Robotics and Mechatronics - Building & Programming Circuits; Digital & Analog Interactions

These resources will be made freely available to all teachers and students. InTEACT also welcomes contributions from other educators, students, professionals and interested parties - simply submit a pull request if you would like to contribute other resources and activities.

Structure will be added to the repository in the coming months as educators involved in InTEACT workshops identify the most suitable approach to managing the resource collection.6
